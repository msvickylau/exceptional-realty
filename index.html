		title= is optional but when you hover over the image it will have a title.
		alt- reads out lout to visially impared, and search engin sees these words
		foldername/ = go inside the folder.
		filename = ise a file in the current folder
		../ = leave the current folder and go up to the parent folder
		so everytime you're going up a level, you would use ../../images/intro-pic.jpg == vlau
